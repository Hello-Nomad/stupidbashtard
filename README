Welcome to Stupid BashTard (SBT).


-- Stupid BashTard
SBT is a framework comprised of shell scripts full of functions.  In short, I got tired of rewriting, and watching others rewrite, the same exact types of functionality over and over again.  The goal of SBT is to create an open-source library of functions usable in Bash shell scripting (and possibly others eventually).

-- Tools Driving SBT
Bash, like all tools, has pros and cons.  All functions in SBT are Bash functions, but they will often push the real work on to other linux tools: perl, sed, awk, coreutils programs, and so forth.  These tools are usually part of most linux distributions (GNU/Linux).  But for portability, all the external tools SBT uses will have source code included, and a build script to compile them locally.

-- Docker
A static analysis tool is used to read functions and put information about them into YAML files.  Ultimately, these could be useful as description pop-ups in an IDE.


MORE INFO
More details about SBT and Docker are available in the SBT namespace 'doc_examples.sh'.
