Welcome to Stupid BashTard (SBT).


-- Stupid BashTard
SBT is a framework comprised of shell scripts full of functions.  In short, I got tired of rewriting, and watching others rewrite, the same exact types of functionality over and over again.  The goal of SBT is to create an open-source library of functions usable in Bash shell scripting (and possibly others eventually).

-- Singular Principle
SBT adheres to one rule above all others: if it isn't simple, repeatable, and easy to use, it's written wrong.  Bash is dangerously simple.  By following simple standards and regression testing, SBT should always remain useful, not cumbersome.  When we stick to its built-ins, Bash can operate very quickly too.  Operations which Bash stinks at should be passed to backend tools via function wrappers.

-- Shocker
A static analysis tool is used to read functions and put information about them into YAML files.  Ultimately, these could be useful as description pop-ups in an IDE.

-- Support
I am not God's gift to scripting.  I fully expect, and hope, others will provide support and feedback to make SBT as optimized as possible.  Ultimately leading to the most effective, performant, and portable Bash library around, all based on open-source tools.

-- Dependencies
SBT requires a few basic tools (rm, cp, ...) which are generally provided by util-linux or similar.  It also leans heavily on GNU coreutils and GNU grep (your grep must support -P).  Finally, some functions use awk (any modern flavor) and perl (5+).

MORE INFO
More details about SBT and Shocker are available in the SBT namespace 'doc_examples.sh'.

There is also a FAQ sheet which can answer a lot of questions.
