Ability to store core_LogVerbose into a file and/or std out

Need to util-linux source as part of SBT lib. Mostly for uuidgen and others.

Need core_SetTrap and a core_RegisterForShutdown and core_ProcessShutdownRegistry

Niceness feature: create an all-lower-case version of function names as wrappers

__SBT variables ar eall upper case, but _VAR variables are not.  The caps doesn't mean "read only"... maybe it should?
