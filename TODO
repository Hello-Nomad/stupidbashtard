Ability to store core_LogVerbose into a file and/or std out

Docker isn't stripping the colon after a long-opt in the options list

Need to util-linux source as part of SBT lib. Mostly for uuidgen and others.

Need core_SetTrap and a core_RegisterForShutdown and core_ProcessShutdownRegistry

Niceness feature: create an all-lower-case version of function names as wrappers

Need to add a local OPTIND to each function to ensure no problems with core_getopts.  Will leave __SBT_SHORT_OPTIND alone.

__SBT variables ar eall upper case, but _VAR variables are not.  The caps doesn't mean "read only"... maybe it should?
