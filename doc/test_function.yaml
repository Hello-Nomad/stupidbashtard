        The first option (after shifting from getopts) will be a file name to operate on.
  basic:
    - name: Description
      text: |
        A complex function attempting to show most (or all) of the things/ways you can document stuff.
        We will attempt to read a file and list the line number and first occurence of a Zelda keyword.
        
        This is a SILLY script that is untested; for demonstration purposes only.

  exit:
    - name: E_GENERIC
      text: |
        If we need to exit and don't have a better ERROR choice, use this.
    - name: E_BAD_INPUT
      text: |
        Send when file specified in $1 is invalid or when -D is blank.
  option:
    - name: h
      text: |
        Display an error and return non-zero if the user tries to use -h for this function.
    - name: D
      text: |
        Add bonus items to the index_array variable.
        Note, this option can be specified multiple times, so always concatenate the array.
    - name: help
      text: |
        Display an error and return non-zero if the user tries to use -h for this function.
    - name: v
      text: |
        Change the verbose flag to true so we can send more output to the caller.
  variable:
    - name: index_array
      text: |
        Index array with 1 element (element 0, value of Zelda)
    - name: wife_is_hot
      text: |
        Pointless boolean flag, and it is now read only (and accurate).
    - name: VERBOSE
      text: |
        Flag to decide if we should be chatty with our output.
    - name: temp
      text: |
        A temp variable for our operations below.  (Note: Docker will record defaults.)
    - name: assoc_array
      text: |
        Associative array (hash) to hold misc things as we read file.
    - name: final_value
      text: |
        The final value to expose to the caller after we exit. (Note: Docker will flag as by-ref.)
    - name: i
      text: |
        A counter variable, forced to be integer only.
