|   Comment: Added core_Error and core_getopts to the sbt core.sh namespace.  I'm going to need getopts immensely, and core is always required.  So this will help.  Wrote several tests to help with the core namespace.

|   Comment: Finally got core_getopts largely finished.  The actual test and loop structures bug me for some reason, but I think that's just the I-hate-nested-if-blocks person in me.  Now that I've solidified the outcome, I might be able to step back and improve the code.  That said, it's realllly fast in my testing.  Still need to finish writing unit tests for it.  These are getting big too... might need to write entire scripts, one for each function rather than for a whole namespace.

|   Comment: Wrote the majority of the core_getopts replacement function.  Still needs fine details and then actual testing.  Need to research any other built-in things which happen to help with backward compatibility.  I'm also considering writing a reset of some sort so you can call getopts multiple times (e.g. function calls with getopts in them) without having to set a local OPTIND or whatever... not sure if this is a good idea or not.  Might be best to always reset with a local OPTIND=1 declaration.  When finished, need to write tests for it.

|   Comment: Renamed the namespaces folder to sbt, since that's where the core will live.  Created a shell script to generate a changelog file from the git history.  Update docker to reflect a few changes, mostly cosmetic.  Updated the docker.sh test script to ensure it can successfully scan a complex function and generate the correct file.  Also added the LICENSE and NOTICE files, though I'm pretty sure I'm using NOTICE file incorrectly.

|   Comment: Got tags all fixed nice and pretty.  Options are now captured in a simplistic property with only 1 attribute: has_arg.  Might want to redo this one like the variables property if more than 1 property attribute is required, but for now it works.  Need to finish the add_variable function.  It should be quite simple if my anonymous array stuff works right.

Also have a list of bugs that need to be worked out.  After that, I need to extensively test docker and build new functions in doc_example.sh to regression test docker.

|   Comment: Fixed some of the regex, but most of it still needs fixed.  Got derailed trying to find out why my getters and setters weren't working.  Had to fix them in Function.pm.  I now need to modify the save function to save each tag set line by line to prepend the spacing, otherwise the yaml will fold back and get confused.

|   Comment: Finished the save functions.  Tweaking regex patterns in it to be more useful.  Currently working on getting the variable tags to infer properly.  Regex pattern in bla.pl works but isn't working in my if statement for some reason.  I think my understanding of the if construct is wrong.  I should proabably disuse the parenthesis if its just a pattern match.  After the regex patterns are fixed, I need to find a way to distinguish between local and global variable to mark thread safety (or quit this feature).  Also need to find out why the actual text of the tags isn't going into the yaml file.  Then confirm my yaml format is valid.

|   Comment: Switched more function logic into the actual object.  Still not going extreme OO as it's largely uncessecary and I don't quite care at the moment.  Finished up more of the flush to disk logic, should be YAML format now.  Still need to change the add_tag function to find and place items into the correct tag hashes.

|   Comment: Add a testing file for perl (bla.pl).  Added some switches to handle the usage.  Added functions to print out intelligently based on switches (verbose and quiet, as well as error).  Made the fatal routine always exit (was named print_err); always goes to STDERR.  Created the routine (load_files) to read arguments first, then if empty read all .sh files from LIB_DIR.
