|   Comment: Updated the TODO with a couple items I realized I did stupidly.  Modified core_getopts to support resetting of __SBT_SHORT_OPTIND when options parsing is done; a niceness feature.  Made minor changes to the mt_RunDispatcher, ready to start fleshing it and everything else out a LOT more.

|   Comment: Prefixed all variables (except exit codes, because Docker reads those) with an underscore.  This enforces the idea of globals being __SBT_something and lexically scoped variables to functions like so: _something.  This fixes #4 and should prevent confusion for end-users later.

|   Comment: Huge changes to the way data is read in.  Added a FAQ to help document some of these standards.  This should help tremendously with future functions.  Wrote (or rewrote) tests to ensure it all works as expected.  Ultimately, this will allow me to simply send DATA as a herestring to any function or external program... the program merely needs to support consumption of STDIN.

|   Comment: Started researching how to read STDIN in functions for piping.  It's quite possible and whatnot but it has a couple repercussions.  First there's a race condition causing SIGPIPEs when testing with read -t 0.  Second, any output not echo'd with a new line will not be read properly (last line will hang).  I'd like SBT functions to auto-detect STDIN but I don't think it's possible.  So I either need a switch for it as a standard; or I need the rule to be: if no args are sent, try to read from stdin, then error out if still no data to work with.

|   Comment: Wrote a perl script to do the CountOf logic.  It works fine, except when dealing with hidden characters like newlines.  Perl can count them but Bash seems to ignore one.  For example, in a sample document with 7 or 8 lines I got #var to return 79, but perl returned 80 matches for all chars ([\s\S]).  Need to find out why this is happening and decide which is actually correct... my guess is perl.

|   Comment: Added a special test folder for proofs of decisions made: echo vs printf, true/false vs 0/1, etc.  Fixed a bug in the core_getopts function: when the last item in compact short options (-abc) requires an argument (-abc 'value for c') it moves OPTIND and doesn't reset __SBT_SHORT_OPTIND to 1.  I think I fixed something else too, but it was minor.  Either way, all tests are passing and I'm clear to move on to the next item.

|   Comment: Ok, so... found a few problems in the test scripts for core_getopts and had to fix those.  Testing functions weren't reporting correctly so things were passing that shouldn't.  The actual core_getopts function had a couple problems that needed fixed: compacted short option handling, and a break where a return 0 should have been.  Finished the string_IndexOf tests.  In the process, discovered a real-world case (added to tests for core_getopts):  if the error suppression is signaled (with a leading colon) in long opts, and the first long opt requires a parameter (has a colon at the end), then the tokenization and string comparison messes up.  Finally, updated all the test scripts to set the first path entry to the tool directory for SBT, ensuring all test cases happen again the compiled tools.  When I start doing regression testing against various version of libs/tools this will come in handy.

In hindsight, I won't use it for what I thought, but I could see how it might be useful in other situations and the performance hit should be almost zero.  Need to check out the TODO list and probably focus on building a usage tag next.

Might also want to consider letting it read a whole file, but then again how would that work with newlines?  I'd have to read in multiline mode and I don't know if that's even possible in awk.  Oh well, baby steps for now.

|   Comment: Changed the logging up a bit, all messages go to std err.  Updated tests to disuse MD5 sum since line numbers will change.  Did some performance testing with a DEBUG/verbose mode.  Also watched a lot a movies, so didn't actually get much done.  Meh.

|   Comment: Added core_Error and core_getopts to the sbt core.sh namespace.  I'm going to need getopts immensely, and core is always required.  So this will help.  Wrote several tests to help with the core namespace.

|   Comment: Finally got core_getopts largely finished.  The actual test and loop structures bug me for some reason, but I think that's just the I-hate-nested-if-blocks person in me.  Now that I've solidified the outcome, I might be able to step back and improve the code.  That said, it's realllly fast in my testing.  Still need to finish writing unit tests for it.  These are getting big too... might need to write entire scripts, one for each function rather than for a whole namespace.

|   Comment: Wrote the majority of the core_getopts replacement function.  Still needs fine details and then actual testing.  Need to research any other built-in things which happen to help with backward compatibility.  I'm also considering writing a reset of some sort so you can call getopts multiple times (e.g. function calls with getopts in them) without having to set a local OPTIND or whatever... not sure if this is a good idea or not.  Might be best to always reset with a local OPTIND=1 declaration.  When finished, need to write tests for it.

|   Comment: Renamed the namespaces folder to sbt, since that's where the core will live.  Created a shell script to generate a changelog file from the git history.  Update docker to reflect a few changes, mostly cosmetic.  Updated the docker.sh test script to ensure it can successfully scan a complex function and generate the correct file.  Also added the LICENSE and NOTICE files, though I'm pretty sure I'm using NOTICE file incorrectly.

|   Comment: Got tags all fixed nice and pretty.  Options are now captured in a simplistic property with only 1 attribute: has_arg.  Might want to redo this one like the variables property if more than 1 property attribute is required, but for now it works.  Need to finish the add_variable function.  It should be quite simple if my anonymous array stuff works right.

Also have a list of bugs that need to be worked out.  After that, I need to extensively test docker and build new functions in doc_example.sh to regression test docker.

|   Comment: Fixed some of the regex, but most of it still needs fixed.  Got derailed trying to find out why my getters and setters weren't working.  Had to fix them in Function.pm.  I now need to modify the save function to save each tag set line by line to prepend the spacing, otherwise the yaml will fold back and get confused.

|   Comment: Finished the save functions.  Tweaking regex patterns in it to be more useful.  Currently working on getting the variable tags to infer properly.  Regex pattern in bla.pl works but isn't working in my if statement for some reason.  I think my understanding of the if construct is wrong.  I should proabably disuse the parenthesis if its just a pattern match.  After the regex patterns are fixed, I need to find a way to distinguish between local and global variable to mark thread safety (or quit this feature).  Also need to find out why the actual text of the tags isn't going into the yaml file.  Then confirm my yaml format is valid.

|   Comment: Switched more function logic into the actual object.  Still not going extreme OO as it's largely uncessecary and I don't quite care at the moment.  Finished up more of the flush to disk logic, should be YAML format now.  Still need to change the add_tag function to find and place items into the correct tag hashes.

Made the fatal routine always exit (was named print_err); always goes to STDERR.  Created the routine (load_files) to read arguments first, then if empty read all .sh files from LIB_DIR.
