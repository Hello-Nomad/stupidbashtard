Installation is a whimsical idea.  SBT is a series of shell scripts with functions

Simply copy the sbt/ folder (with files like core.sh, array.sh, etc) to whatever location you want.

From there, just source it from your script...

[your_script.sh]
#!/bin/bash
if ! . /path/to/sbt/core.sh ; then
  echo "Failed to load SBT." >&2
  exit 1
fi


The only real stipulation is you MUST load core.sh before any other namespaces.

You do NOT have to load all of the SBT namespaces (no cross-namespace dependencies).
E.g.:  If you just want array.sh, you only need to load core.sh and array.sh.
